            "Justification": "Random forest classifier generates multiple decision trees by using a technique called bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating), where multiple subsets of the training data are sampled with replacement to train individual decision trees. This approach helps to reduce variance and improve the overall accuracy of the model."

            "Answer": "C",
            "Justification": "Transforming a time series with a unit root for analysis with an AR model is commonly done by differencing the series. First-differencing removes the trend, making the series stationary, which is a requirement for the Autoregressive (AR) model. This method is often known as the Integrated (I) part of the ARIMA model."
