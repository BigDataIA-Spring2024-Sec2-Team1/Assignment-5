Summary:
- Data types include numerical (continuous and discrete) and categorical (nominal and ordinal).
- Data are organized for analysis in arrays or tables.
- Frequency distributions reveal distribution patterns.
- Contingency tables cross-tabulate categorical variables.
- Data visualizations include histograms, bar charts, tree-maps, word clouds, line charts, scatter plots, and heat maps.
- Visualization selection depends on the purpose (distribution, relationships, comparisons).
- Central tendency measures include mean, median, and mode.
- Mean types are arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic.
- Dispersion measures are range, MAD, variance, standard deviation, and target downside deviation.
- Skewness describes distribution symmetry.
- Kurtosis measures tail weight relative to the distribution.
- Correlation measures variable associations but not causation.

Tables, figures, and equations here should be employed to illustrate concepts like the formula for standard deviation or visual comparison between distributions with different skews.

Please note that the above summary provides a framework for understanding various concepts within the LOS and is not meant to replace actual readings or detailed analysis for investment purposes.

Understanding central tendency, frequency distribution, and measures like skewness and kurtosis, provides a foundation for evaluating investment returns and risks. Familiarity with various visualization tools, such as histograms and scatter plots, is valuable for interpreting data patterns and correlations effectively, essential skills for a financial analyst aiming to make informed investment decisions.
