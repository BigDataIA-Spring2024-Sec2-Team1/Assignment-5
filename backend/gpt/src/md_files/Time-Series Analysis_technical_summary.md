- Predicted trend for time series:
  - Linear: \( \hat{Y}_t = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 t \)
  - Log-linear: \( e^{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 t} \)
- Linear trends for constant amount growth, log-linear for constant rate
- Trend models limitations indicated by error term serial correlation
- Autoregressive model (AR(p)):
  - \( X_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + ... + \beta_p X_{t-p} + \epsilon_t \)
- Covariance stationary requirements
- Nonstationary series detectable by trends and nonconstant variance
- AR model fit tested through error term autocorrelations
- Mean reversion: Tendency to return to long-run mean
- Forecasts:

  - One-period-ahead AR(1): \( \hat{X}_{t+1} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_t \)
  - Two-period-ahead extension
- In-sample vs. out-of-sample forecasts, evaluated using RMSE
- Time-series model coefficients instability
- Random walks: Series value at time t is previous value plus random error
- Unit roots nonstationarity and AR model transformation by first-differencing
- Seasonality modeled by including seasonal lags
- Moving-average model (MA(q)) distinguishes by autocorrelation pattern
- ARMA models limitations: Parameter instability, difficult order determination, potential poor forecasting
- ARCH: Error variance dependence on previous errors' variance
- Testing for ARCH(1): Regression of squared residuals
- Time-series variables in linear regression: Unit root and cointegration analysis
- Dickeyâ€“Fuller test for cointegration checking

# The above list effectively captures the key technical notes from the CFA syllabus content for a candidate to understand and remember. It's concise and covers each important aspect, such as models, forecasts, mean reversion, random walks, ARCH, and regression considerations in a clearly bulleted format. Well done!
